# notes-app

Tiny Go notes API I'm using to learn:

- Go interfaces and structs
- net/http handlers
- JSON encode/decode
- Basic REST patterns (GET/POST/DELETE)

Endpoints:
- `GET /notes` – list all notes
- `POST /notes` – create a note
- `GET /notes/{id}` – get a single note
- `DELETE /notes/{id}` – delete a note
